# Learning Powershell

This demonstrates my process of learning the Powershell scripting language.

## Demos

- [Subcommands](Subcommands/): building git-like `command <subcommand> [args]` tools.
- [MsSqlDockerScripts (repository)](https://github.com/bitkompagniet/MsSqlDockerScripts): a module for creating, importing and exporting MSSQL docker instances.
